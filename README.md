- AVMA4k - Offline AVMA activation for over 4000 years (Server 2012 R2+ only)
- Reset Rearm Count - Reset rearm counter for infinite evaluation
- Reset Eval Period - Reset evaluation period for infinite evaluation
- Dump/Load Trusted Store - Dump and load trusted store data
- Delete Unique ID - Delete a product key's unique ID to prevent online validation
- Install Generated Product Key - Install generated product key data for any product
- KMS Charger - Charge an existing KMS server to allow immediate use for activation
- Clear Tamper State - Clear the tamper state set due to store corruption or deletion
- Remove Evaluation Key Lock - Remove the product key change lock set for evaluation product keys
- Set IID Parameters - Set parameters for IID independently of installed key

## FAQ

### How does this work?

This tool manipulates data stored in a file known as the "physical store", which is used by Windows to store critical activation data, including expiry timers and the HWIDs bound to each license. Thanks to our reverse-engineering efforts, we are able to insert our own data into the physical store, allowing us to add custom activation data for any product managed by Windows' Software Protection Platform. The data in the physical store is also known as the "trusted store", leading to the name "TSforge".

### What advantages does this method have over other activation methods?

TSforge offers the most advantages for activating older Windows versions, such as Windows 7 through 8.1, as it can permanently activate any edition of these versions without modifications to the boot process or Windows system executables. TSforge is also the only public activator capable of activating any Windows addon, making it useful for users who wish to activate ESU licenses. Additionally, TSforge is the only public activator to offer hardware-invariant activation without any persistent network connections, added services/tasks, or injected DLLs.

TLDR: You should only use TSforge if you are using an old Windows release or if you want to activate addons such as ESU to extend the support end date.

### What are the downsides?

For Windows 10 and 11, it is recommended to use the HWID method to activate Windows. TSforge is both less reliable and lacks features that HWID offers, such as the ability to survive feature upgrades and complete OS reinstalls. For Windows 7 through 8.1, there are no notable downsides.

### Do any of the methods here require internet?

No, none of the methods presented here require connecting to the internet in order to function. Everything is done locally.

### How can I install specific licenses without having to install the corresponding product key?

You can use the `/igpk` switch in TSforge in order to install licenses by only using an Activation ID. You can get a list of all installable licenses and their Activation ID's by running `slmgr /dlv all`. You can click into the popup window and press CTRL + C to copy all of the information. Once you have found your desired licenses' Activation ID, run `/igpk` like so: `TSforge.exe /igpk <activation id>`.

### How do I activate a KMS Host server?

You can use the `/igpk` and `/zcid` options with the activation ID of the KMS Host SKU to be activated. You can then use the `/kmsc` option with this activation ID to charge the KMS server with 25 clients. Please note that KMS servers will maintain their client counts for a maximum of 30 days.

### What features are implemented in Windows Vista?

The following options are implemented:

 - `/dump`
 - `/load`
 - `/zcid`
 - `/kms4k`
 - `/rtmr`
 - `/rrmc`
 - `/kmsc`
 - `/ctpr`

The following options are NOT implemented:

 - `/duid` - Key Unique ID is not removable from Vista physical store
 - `/igpk` - Product key data is derived directly from the key string, preventing forgery
 - `/siid` - IID is also derived directly from the key string
 - `/revl` - Eval key lock is not present on Vista

 Effectively, this means that a product key must be provided to activate a given SKU. Additionally, ZeroCID on Vista/Server 2008 lacks protection against deactivation due to the WGA update KB929391, though this update is no longer offered via Windows Update.

### How do I prevent de-activation due to WAT on Windows 7?

If generic keys are installed, you need to run `TSforge.exe /duid` to remove the product key's unique ID. This will prevent WAT from verifying the key online. Installing a fake product key with `TSforge.exe /igpk <activation id>` will have an equivalent effect. Alternatively, you can use a non-generic key to bypass this check, though many publicly available keys are blocked by WAT.

### AVMA4k doesn't work in my virtual machine, why?

Windows doesn't support AVMA activation under VM software that fails to provide [Hyper-V Enlightenments](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/i386/hyperv.html). This primarily means that AVMA4k is only supported on VMs running under a [correctly configured QEMU instance](https://blog.wikichoon.com/2014/07/enabling-hyper-v-enlightenments-with-kvm.html) or Hyper-V. If your VM's activation status is `Notification` with the status code `0xC004FD01` after using AVMA4k, you will need to use another activation method.

### Does TSforge support beta versions of Windows?

It can, though we do not provide official support for these versions. TSforge works on most insider/beta builds of Windows past Windows 8.1. Beta builds prior to build 9600 are likely to face issues, as the internal data formats used by SPP were constantly changing during this period of development. Builds with similar licensing behavior to retail versions are the most likely to work with the current TSforge codebase. For other builds, you may need to manually edit the source code of LibTSforge to get it to work.

### How do I remove this activation?

Run [Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://massgrave.dev), select `Troubleshoot` > `Fix Licensing`. This will reset the physical store and revert any changes made by TSforge.

### Can Microsoft patch this?

Yes, albeit with some amount of difficulty.

### Will they?

Probably not. If they do, please tell us so we can laugh to ourselves like a bunch of lunatics for the rest of the week.
